      Runs a Bourne shell script, typically on a Unix node. Multiple lines are accepted.

      An interpreter selector may be used, for example: `#!/usr/bin/perl`

      Otherwise the system default shell will be run, using the `-xe` flags (you can specify `set +e` and/or `set +x` to disable those).
