= unarchive

The `unarchive` step can help retrieve archived artifacts into the current
agent's executing workspace. This pattern allows using one agent for building
artifacts, and retrieving them on other agents for further use in the pipeline.


.Simple archive/unarchive
[source]
----
stage {
  name = 'Build'
  steps {
    sh 'make release'
    archive 'build/release/hello-world'
  }
}
stage {
  name = 'Test'
  steps {
    unarchive 'hello-world'
    sh 'chmod +x hello-world && ./hello-world'
  }
}

.Unarchiving patterns

archive artifacts: 'target/release/*.tar.gz', name: 'release-builds'


unarchive 'release-builds'
