= Parser service

The Otto Parser Service presents the parser crate as an HTTP service.

The `apispec.yml` is an link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_API[OpenAPI]
specification that describes the public HTTP endpoints that the parser service
provides.


== Development

Unit test and integration tests for the parser service are located in the usual
Rust locations, and can all be run via `cargo test`.

Running the acceptance tests however requires the
link:https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis[schemathesis] tool for
automating OpenAPI-based acceptance tests. In order to execute acceptance tests, run the parser service in one termainal: `cargo run -p otto-parser` and then in another:

[source,bash]
----
schemathesis run ./services/parser/apispec.yml --base-url=http://localhost:7672 --checks all
----


The server can be run in an auto-reloading fashion with link:https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch[cargo-watch] and link:https://github.com/passcod/catflap[catlap] via:

[source,bash]
----
catflap -p 7672 -- cargo watch -x "run -p otto-parser"
----
