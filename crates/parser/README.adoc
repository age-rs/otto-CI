= Otto Parser

**Issue label:** `components/parser`

The Otto Parser is a link:https://pest.rs/[Pest] based parser which takes the
Otto pipeline syntax and converts it into the Otto intermediate pipeline
representation.

In the `src/` directory you will find the `.pest` grammar definition which
outlines the currently supported Otto Pipeline syntax.

== Tests

There are unit tests defined in `.rs` files inside of `src/`.

The `test_data/` directory has two directories: `invalid` and `valid`. These
files are used to validate basic parsing of the Otto pipeline syntax. No other
validation is done on these files other than ensuring that they parse
(`valid/`) or that they do not parse (`invalid/`).
