= Writing steps for Otto



== Caching

If the manifest contains `cache: true`, the agent will create a cache directory
for this step to be used by all invocations. The location of the step's caching
directory will be available in the invocation file:

.Example invocation file snippet for the `git` step
[source,yaml]
----
configuration:
  cache: '/home/otto/caches/git'
parameters:
----

The location of this caching directory should **not** be treated as
deterministic, and can change at any time. Steps should always rely on the
`cache` key in the invocation file's `configuration` block.
